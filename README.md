## Burns Depression Checklist
David D. Burns is a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine and the author of the best-selling book The New Mood Therapy. He has also played a role in the development of cognitive behavioral therapy, a drug-free treatment for depression and anxiety.

This project, written in ReactJS (which I am still getting my head around), allows the user to fill out the checklist online, and will calculate the result.

This is currently a work in progress.
